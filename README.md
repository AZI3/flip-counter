[demo](https://brianjzhang.github.io/flip-counter/dist/index.html)

## Installation

``` bash
 npm install flip-counter-js --save
```

## Usage
1. Create an element, e.g. `<div>` in your HTML template and set `data-flip-counter-js` attribute on this element. Refer to the options and configure it as required.
    ``` html
    <div data-flip-counter-js data-fc-size="lg" data-fc-step="11" data-fc-speed="500"
             data-fc-minDigits="10"
             data-fc-start="10"></div>
    ```
2. Import _FlipCounterJs_ module. The JavaScript file is generated by Webpack and it supports both CommonJs and AMD.
    ``` javascript
    import FlipCounter from 'flip-counter-js';
    ```
    Else you can find it on global _window_ object.
    ``` javascript
    <script src="node_modules/flip-counter-js/dist/flip-counter-js.js"></script>
    ```    
3. Finally don't forget to include the css style.
    ``` html
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./node_modules/flip-counter-js/dist/css/style.min.css"/>
    ```  
4. There is another way to create an instance using JavaScript API:
    ``` javascript
        var fc = new FlipCounterJs(document.getElementById('fcElement',{
            speed: 0
        });
        
        fc.increment(10); // Add 10
    ```
